# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Open Voice UI

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for a project that aims to make the OpenVoice tool more accessible and user-friendly. The project will provide a graphical user interface (UI), a simplified installation process, and a containerized application for easy deployment. This will allow users to utilize the powerful voice cloning capabilities of OpenVoice without extensive technical knowledge.

## 2. Goals

*   **Simplify Usage:** To create a user-friendly interface that abstracts away the command-line operations of the OpenVoice tool.
*   **Improve Quality:** To provide features that allow users to generate more natural and emotionally expressive voice clones.
*   **Easy Installation:** To provide a straightforward setup process for all dependencies and required programs.
*   **Portability and Deployment:** To package the application in a Docker container for easy distribution and deployment across different systems.
*   **One-Click Execution:** To enable users to start the application with a single command.

## 3. Features

### 3.1. User Interface (UI)

*   **Tone Color File Upload:** A simple interface to upload a short audio file (3-10 seconds) to define the core voice tone.
*   **Style Reference File Upload:** An optional interface to upload a separate audio file to define the speaking style (emotion, rhythm, pace).
*   **File Format Guidance:** Clear text in the UI indicating acceptable audio formats (e.g., .wav, .mp3) for uploads.
*   **Text Input:** A text area for users to input the text they want to be spoken in the cloned voice.
*   **Generate Button:** A button to trigger the voice cloning process.
*   **Progress Indicator:** A visual loading indicator (e.g., a spinner) that appears after clicking the "Generate" button, informing the user that processing is underway. The button will be disabled during this time.
*   **Result Display:** A section to display the generated audio file, with an option to play it and download it.

### 32. Installation and Setup

*   **Automated Script:** A script that automates the installation of all necessary dependencies.
*   **Docker Support:** A Dockerfile to create a self-contained environment with all dependencies pre-installed.

### 3.3. Execution

*   **Command File:** A command file (e.g., `run.sh` or `run.bat`) to start the application and UI without needing to use the terminal.

### 3.4. Deployment

*   **Multi-architecture Docker Image:** A Docker image that supports multiple architectures (e.g., x86, ARM) for wider compatibility.

## 4. User Flow

1.  **Start the Application:** The user runs the command file to start the application.
2.  **Open the UI:** The user opens a web browser and navigates to the application's URL.
3.  **Upload Tone Color Audio:** The user uploads a short audio file of the voice they want to clone.
4.  **(Optional) Upload Style Reference Audio:** The user uploads a second audio file to act as a style reference.
5.  **Input Text:** The user enters the text they want to convert to speech.
6.  **Generate Audio:** The user clicks the "Generate" button. The button becomes disabled and a loading indicator appears.
7.  **Listen and Download:** After a short wait, the loading indicator disappears, the button is re-enabled, and the application provides the generated audio file for playback and download.
